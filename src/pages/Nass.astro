The game features a player character that can jump, run, and collect items while avoiding enemies powered by state machine AI and A* pathfinding. Multiple levels were created using Unity's tilemap system, with event systems and multiple input sources for smooth gameplay. Extensive playtesting, optimization, and problem solving ensured a polished experience."

Additionally, I would implement a timer to track the speed the player completes levels and displays it on the screen and add a leaderboard to enhance the competitive aspect of the game.'
