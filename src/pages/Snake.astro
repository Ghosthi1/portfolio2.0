I updated the way the snake changed direction to a vector this made it easier to calculate the position of the snake on the grid.I then removed the last item in the snake array to tidy up the tail. This allowed me to draw the snake in the correct position on the grid and give the impression of movement."

The game features a grid-based coordinate system with precise collision detection mechanics. Players control a snake that grows as it consumes food while avoiding self-collision. The implementation showcases proper game loop architecture, real-time state management."
